### Summary
This webpage accomplished a reasonable presentation of the data. One drawback of the page is that there is no visualizations of the data.
### Recommendations 

- Include Charts to visualize the data, with statistics like:
 number of reports per state, number of sightings each year, number of sigtings per shape, tracking sightings with the same shape near the same time over a geographical area.
 - This is a perfect place to use the google maps API to visualize where these calls are coming from. 
 - Include a form to submit a sighting
